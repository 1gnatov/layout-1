PSD to HTML 1
========
My first frontend work, I've found free PSD design and trying to make a template from it.
I used git + html5 + css3 + js here.
All icons are in sprites.
I really appreciate all pull requests with advices how to refactor my code.

JS Libraries I used:
======
* jQuery
* fancybox
* slidesjs
